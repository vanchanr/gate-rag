vanchanr: I am developing a GATE exam preparation assistant for DA subject.

in each of data/md/{subject} folder:
- there is a syllabus.md file
- all other files are previous year question papers analyze the GATE exam question patterns, difficult level and mapping between syllabus topics and questions from each of data/md/{subject} folder where subject is "CS", "DA", "EC", "CH"

then for each topic and subtopic in /workspaces/gate-rag/data/md/DA/syllabus_tree.md generate around 2-10 bullet points which may contain most important concepts, formulae, tips , tricks for answering new questions on that concept.

First generate for "Probability and Statistics" topic and its subtopics. I will prompt for other topics further in the chat

Workspace: Collecting workspace information

Based on the available workspace data, I'll analyze the Probability and Statistics questions from previous GATE papers and create a comprehensive study guide for the topic:

# Probability and Statistics

### Counting & Basic Probability
- Master permutations (nPr = n!/(n-r)!) and combinations (nCr = n!/r!(n-r)!) formulas
- For independent events: P(A∩B) = P(A) × P(B)
- For mutually exclusive events: P(A∪B) = P(A) + P(B)
- Commonly tested: Dice rolls, coin flips, card selections
- Key trick: Draw probability tree diagrams for complex conditional problems

### Conditional Probability & Bayes Theorem
- P(A|B) = P(A∩B)/P(B)
- Bayes Theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A)×P(A)/P(B)
- Common trap: Check if events are truly independent
- Remember to use law of total probability for denominator in Bayes
- Look for keywords like "given", "if", "when" in questions

### Random Variables & Distributions
- For discrete: Ensure PMF sums to 1
- For continuous: Area under PDF must be 1
- Binomial: n trials, p success probability
  - Mean = np, Variance = np(1-p)
- Poisson: For rare events with rate λ
  - Mean = Variance = λ
- Normal Distribution:
  - 68-95-99.7 rule for ±1,2,3 standard deviations
  - Standardization: Z = (X-μ)/σ

### Expectation & Variance
- E[aX + b] = aE[X] + b
- Var(X) = E[(X-μ)²] = E[X²] - (E[X])²
- For independent X,Y:
  - E[XY] = E[X]×E[Y]
  - Var(aX + bY) = a²Var(X) + b²Var(Y)
- Covariance: Cov(X,Y) = E[(X-μx)(Y-μy)]
- Correlation: ρ = Cov(X,Y)/(σx×σy)

### Statistical Tests
- Z-test: When population σ known, large samples
- T-test: When population σ unknown
- Chi-square test: For categorical data, goodness of fit
- P-value interpretation:
  - p < 0.05 typically rejects null hypothesis
  - Smaller p-value = stronger evidence

### Tips for GATE Questions
- Practice standard distribution calculations with tables
- Questions often mix concepts - watch for conditional probability in distribution problems
- Many questions ask for "rounded to decimal places" - be careful with final answers
- Common question pattern: Given joint probability table, find marginal/conditional probabilities
- For numerical problems, always check units and reasonable value ranges

This analysis is based on patterns observed in previous GATE papers, particularly from CS2014.md, DA2024.md, and other exam papers where probability and statistics questions frequently appear. The difficulty level typically ranges from direct formula application to complex multi-step problems combining multiple concepts.

# Linear Algebra

### Vector Spaces and Subspaces
- Vector space axioms: closure, associativity, distributivity, scalar multiplication
- Key subspaces: Row space, Column space, Null space
- Basis vectors form linearly independent spanning set
- Dimension = number of vectors in basis
- Tip: For subspace verification, check zero vector, closure under addition and scalar multiplication

### Linear Independence & Matrices
- Vectors {v1,...,vn} are linearly independent if c1v1 + ... + cnvn = 0 implies all ci = 0
- For matrix A:
  - rank(A) ≤ min(rows, columns)  
  - rank(A) = rank(AT) = dim(Col A) = dim(Row A)
  - nullity(A) + rank(A) = number of columns
- Common matrix types:
  - Orthogonal: AAT = ATA = I
  - Idempotent: A2 = A
  - Projection: P2 = P and PT = P

### Systems of Linear Equations
- Ax = b has:
  - Unique solution if rank(A) = rank([A|b]) = n
  - No solution if rank(A) < rank([A|b])
  - Infinite solutions if rank(A) = rank([A|b]) < n
- Gaussian elimination steps:
  - Forward elimination to get upper triangular
  - Back substitution for solution
- LU decomposition helps solve multiple systems with same A

### Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors 
- For Ax = λx:
  - det(A - λI) = 0 gives characteristic equation
  - For n×n matrix, sum of eigenvalues = trace(A)
  - Product of eigenvalues = det(A)
- Properties:
  - Similar matrices have same eigenvalues
  - Symmetric matrices have real eigenvalues
  - Orthogonal matrices have eigenvalues with magnitude 1

### Determinant & Special Matrices
- Properties of determinant:
  - det(AB) = det(A)det(B)
  - det(AT) = det(A)
  - det(A-1) = 1/det(A)
- For singular matrix:
  - det = 0
  - Non-invertible
  - Has zero as eigenvalue

### Matrix Decompositions
- LU Decomposition:
  - A = LU where L is lower triangular, U is upper triangular
  - Useful for solving Ax = b efficiently
- Singular Value Decomposition (SVD):
  - A = UΣVT where Σ contains singular values
  - Used in dimensionality reduction, pseudoinverse
- Tips: 
  - Check for positive definiteness using eigenvalues
  - Use row operations to find rank
  - Remember trace equals sum of diagonal elements

### Common Exam Problem Types
- Finding basis of vector spaces/subspaces
- Matrix rank computation using row operations
- Eigenvalue/eigenvector calculations
- Solving systems using Gaussian elimination
- Matrix decomposition (especially LU)

This analysis is based on patterns from previous GATE papers like CS2014.md, CS2015.md and others where linear algebra questions frequently appear. Questions range from direct computations to theoretical proofs and applications.

  - f''(x) < 0: local maximum
  - f''(x) = 0: inconclusive
