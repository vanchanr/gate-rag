A water jet of 20 mm diameter having a velocity of 10 m/s strikes the plate at its mid-point, at an angle of 30° with the vertical. Consider g as 9.81 m/s2 and neglect the self-weight of the plate. The force F (expressed in N) required to keep the plate in its vertical position is _________

Water jet

# Q.47

A 3 m wide rectangular channel carries a flow of 6 m3/s. The depth of flow at a section P is 0.5 m. A flat‑topped hump is to be placed at the downstream of the section P. Assume negligible energy loss between section P and hump, and consider g as 9.81 m/s2. The maximum height of the hump (expressed in m) which will not change the depth of flow at section P is _________

# Q.48

A penstock of 1 m diameter and 5 km length is used to supply water from a reservoir to an impulse turbine. A nozzle of 15 cm diameter is fixed at the end of the penstock. The elevation difference between the turbine and water level in the reservoir is 500 m. Consider the head loss due to friction as 5% of the velocity head available at the jet. Assume unit weight of water = 10 kN/m3 and acceleration due to gravity (g) = 10 m/s2. If the overall efficiency is 80%, power generated (expressed in kW and rounded to nearest integer) is _______________

# Q.49

# Q.52

For a wastewater sample, the three‑day biochemical oxygen demand at incubation temperature of 20 °C (BOD3day, 20°C) is estimated as 200 mg/L. Taking the value of the first order BOD reaction rate constant as 0.22 day−1, the five‑day BOD (expressed in mg/L) of the wastewater at incubation temperature of 20 °C (BOD5day, 20°C) would be _________

# Q.53
