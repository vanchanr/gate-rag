# Q.6

Elvesland is a country that has peculiar beliefs and practices. They express almost all their emotions by gifting flowers. For instance, if anyone gifts a white flower to someone, then it is always taken to be a declaration of one’s love for that person. In a similar manner, the gifting of a yellow flower to someone often means that one is angry with that person.

Based only on the information provided above, which one of the following sets of statement(s) can be logically inferred with certainty?

- (i) In Elvesland, one always declares one’s love by gifting a white flower.
- (ii) In Elvesland, all emotions are declared by gifting flowers.
- (iii) In Elvesland, sometimes one expresses one’s anger by gifting a flower that is not yellow.
- (iv) In Elvesland, sometimes one expresses one’s love by gifting a white flower.

(A) only (ii)

(B) (i), (ii) and (iii)

Based only on the following passage, which one of the options can be inferred with certainty?

When the congregation sang together, Apenyo would also join, though her little screams were not quite audible because of the group singing. But whenever there was a special number, trouble would begin; Apenyo would try singing along, much to the embarrassment of her mother. After two or three such mortifying Sunday evenings, the mother stopped going to church altogether until Apenyo became older and learnt to behave. At home too, Apenyo never kept quiet; she hummed or made up silly songs to sing by herself, which annoyed her mother at times but most often made her become pensive. She was by now convinced that her daughter had inherited her love of singing from her father who had died unexpectedly away from home.

[Excerpt from These Hills Called Home by Temsula Ao]

|(A)|The mother was embarrassed about her daughter’s singing at home.|
|---|---|
|(B)|The mother’s feelings about her daughter’s singing at home were only of annoyance.|
|(C)|The mother was not sure if Apenyo had inherited her love of singing from her father.|
|(D)|When Apenyo hummed at home, her mother tended to become thoughtful.|

The steady-state temperature distribution in a square plate ABCD is governed by the 2-dimensional Laplace equation. The side AB is kept at a temperature of 100 °C and the other three sides are kept at a temperature of 0 °C. Ignoring the effect of discontinuities in the boundary conditions at the corners, the steady-state temperature at the center of the plate is obtained as T0 °C. Due to symmetry, the steady-state temperature at the center will be same (T °C), when any one side of the square is kept at a temperature of 100 °C and the remaining three sides are kept at a temperature of 0 °C. Using the principle of superposition, the value of T0 is _________________________ (rounded off to two decimal places).

# Q.61

A consolidated drained (CD) triaxial test was carried out on a sand sample with the known effective shear strength parameters, c′ = 0 and φ′ = 30°. In the test, prior to the failure, when the sample was undergoing axial compression under constant cell pressure, the drainage valve was accidentally closed. At the failure, 360 kPa deviatoric stress was recorded along with 70 kPa pore water pressure. If the test is repeated without such error, and no back pressure is applied in either of the tests, what is the deviatoric stress (in kPa, in integer) at the failure? _________________
