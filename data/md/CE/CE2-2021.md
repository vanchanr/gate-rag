# Q.52

A grit chamber of rectangular cross-section is to be designed to remove particles with diameter of 0.25 mm and specific gravity of 2.70. The terminal settling velocity of the particles is estimated as 2.5 cm/s. The chamber is having a width of 0.50 m and is to carry a peak wastewater flow of 9720 m3/d giving the depth of flow as 0.75 m. If a flow-through velocity of 0.3 m/s has to be maintained using a proportional weir at the outlet end of the chamber; the minimum length of the chamber (in m, in integer) to remove 0.25 mm particles completely is.

# Q.53

In an aggregate mix; the proportions of coarse aggregate, fine aggregate and specific gravity of the coarse aggregate are 55%, 40% and 2.55, 2.65 and 2.70, respectively. The values of bulk specific gravity of the aggregate mix (round off to two decimal places) is.

# Q.54

The stopping sight distance (SSD) for a level highway is 140 m for the design speed of 90 km/h. The acceleration due to gravity and deceleration rate are 9.81 m/s2 and 3.5 m/s2, respectively. The perception/reaction time (in s, round off to two decimal places) used in the SSD calculation is.

# Q.55

For a 2° curve on a high speed BI, the equilibrium speed is 80 km/h. Consider sanctioned speed is 100 km/h and the maximum dynamic gauge of BG rail as 1750 mm. The angle subtended at its center by a 30.5 m arc. The cant deficiency for the degree of curve is defined as the curve (in mm, round off to integer) is.
