Bhaichung was observing the pattern of people entering and leaving a single Window where customers were being served. He saw that people inevitably came out of the car service centre. There was centre in the order that they went in. However, the time they spent inside seemed to vary a lot: some people came out in a matter of minutes while for others it took much longer. From this, what can one conclude?

(A) The centre operates on a first-come-first-served basis, but with variable service times depending on specific customer needs.

(B) Customers were served in an arbitrary order: since they took varying amounts of time for service completion in the centre.

(C) Since some people came out within a few minutes of entering the centre, the system is likely to operate on a last-come-first-served basis.

(D) Entering the centre early ensured that one would have shorter service times and most people attempted to do this.
