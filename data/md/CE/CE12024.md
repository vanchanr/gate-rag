The minimum angle of shearing resistance of the soil (in degrees) for the critically stable condition of the slope is _____________ (rounded off to the nearest integer).

# Q.55

A soil sample was consolidated at a cell pressure of 20 kPa and a back pressure of 10 kPa for 24 hours during a consolidated undrained (CU) triaxial test. The cell pressure was increased to 30 kPa on the next day and it resulted in the development of pore water pressure of 1 kPa. The soil sample failed when the axial stress was gradually increased to 50 kPa. The pore water pressure at failure was recorded as 21 kPa. The value of Skempton’s pore pressure parameter B for the soil sample is ______________ (rounded off to 2 decimal places).
