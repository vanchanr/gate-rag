# Q.36 – Q.65 Carry TWO marks Each

Q.36 Consider a network path P—Q—R between nodes P and R via router Q. Node P sends a file of size 106 bytes to R via this path by splitting the file into chunks of 103 bytes each. Node P sends these chunks one after the other without any wait time between the successive chunk transmissions. Assume that the size of extra headers added to these chunks is negligible, and that the chunk size is less than the MTU. Each of the links P—Q and Q—R has a bandwidth of 106 bits/sec, and negligible propagation latency. Router Q immediately transmits every packet it receives from P to R, with negligible processing and queueing delays. Router Q can simultaneously receive on link P—Q and transmit on link Q—R. Assume P starts transmitting the chunks at time 𝑡 = 0. Which one of the following options gives the time (in seconds, rounded off to 3 decimal places) at which R receives all the chunks of the file?

# Q.53

Consider two set‑associative cache memory architectures: WBC, which uses the write back policy, and WTC, which uses the write through policy. Both of them use the LRU (Least Recently Used) block replacement policy. The cache memory is connected to the main memory. Which of the following statements is/are TRUE?

- (A) A read miss in WBC never evicts a dirty block
- (B) A read miss in WTC never triggers a write back operation of a cache block to main memory

- (D) A write miss in WTC always writes the victim cache block to main memory before loading the missed block to the cache

# Q.55

The baseline execution time of a program on a 2 GHz single core machine is 100 nanoseconds (ns). The code corresponding to 90% of the execution time can be fully parallelized. The overhead for using an additional core is 10 ns when running on a multicore system. Assume that all cores in the multicore system run their share of the parallelized code for an equal amount of time.

The number of cores that minimize the execution time of the program is ________

# Q.56

A given program has 25% load/store instructions. Suppose the ideal CPI (cycles per instruction) without any memory stalls is 2.

Consider the entries shown below in the forwarding table of an IP router. Each entry consists of an IP prefix and the corresponding next hop router for packets whose destination IP address matches the prefix. The notation “/N” in a prefix indicates a subnet mask with the most significant N bits set to 1.

|Prefix|Next hop router|
|---|---|
|10.1.1.0/24|R1|
|10.1.1.128/25|R2|
|10.1.1.64/26|R3|
|10.1.1.192/26|R4|

This router forwards 20 packets each to 5 hosts. The IP addresses of the hosts are 10.1.1.16, 10.1.1.72, 10.1.1.132, 10.1.1.191, and 10.1.1.205. The number of packets forwarded via the next hop router R2 is _______
