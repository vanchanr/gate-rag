# Q.61

A processor uses a 32-bit instruction format and supports byte-addressable memory access. The ISA of the processor has 150 distinct instructions. The instructions are equally divided into two types, namely R-type and I-type, whose formats are shown below.

OPCODE  UNUSED  DST Register  SRC Register1  SRC Register 2

# I-type Instruction Format:

OPCODE  DST Register  SRC Register  # Immediate value/address

# Q.64

Consider a 32-bit system with 4 KB page size and page table entries of size 4 bytes each. Assume 1 KB = 210 bytes. The OS uses a 2-level page table for memory management, with the page table containing an outer page directory and an inner page table. The OS allocates a page for the outer page directory upon process creation. The OS uses demand paging when allocating memory for the inner page table, i.e., a page of the inner page table is allocated only if it contains at least one valid page table entry. An active process in this system accesses 2000 unique pages during its execution, and none of the pages are swapped out to disk. After it completes the page accesses, let X denote the minimum and Y denote the maximum number of pages across the two levels of the page table of the process.

The value of X+Y is ________
