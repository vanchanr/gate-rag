QH4 A TCP server application is programmed to listen on port number P on host S. TCP client is connected to the TCP server over the network. Consider that while the TCP connection was active, the server machine S crashed and rebooted:

Which of the following behaviors is possible?

- If the client was waiting to receive a packet, it may wait indefinitely.
- The TCP server application on S can listen on P after reboot.
- If the client sends a packet after the server reboot, it will receive a RST segment.
- If the client sends a packet after the server reboot, it will receive a FIN segment.

Q.445 Consider two hosts P and Q connected through a router R. The maximum transfer unit (MTU) value of the link between P and R is 1500 bytes, and between R and Q is 820 bytes. A TCP segment of size 1400 bytes is transferred from P to Q through R with IP identification value as 0x1234. The packet is allowed to be fragmented, the IP header size is 20 bytes. Further, the Don't Fragment (DF) flag in the IP header is not set by P.

Which of the following statements are correct?

- Two fragments are created at R.
- The IP datagram size carrying the second fragment is 620 bytes.
- If the second fragment is lost, R will resend the fragment with the IP identification value 0x1234.
- If the second fragment is lost, P is required to resend the whole TCP segment.
- TCP destination port can be determined by analyzing only the second fragment.

Q.16 Consider the following pseudocode; shared variable S is a semaphore initialized to 5 in line#2. The increment operation in line#7 is not initialized to 0 in line#1. Assume that the counter is:

int counter = 0;
Semaphore S(5);
void parop(void) {
wait(S);
wait(S);
counter++;
signal(S);
signal(S);
}

If five threads execute the function parop concurrently; which of the following program behavior(s) is/are possible?

- (A) The value of counter is 5 after all the threads successfully complete the execution of parop.
- (B) The value of counter is 1 after all the threads successfully complete the execution of parop.
- (C) The value of counter is 0 after all the threads successfully complete the execution of parop.
- (D) There is a deadlock involving all the threads.

Q.A7 Consider a dynamic hashing approach for 4-bit integer keys:

There is a main hash table of size

The 2 least significant bits of a key is used to index into the main hash table:

Thereafter, when more keys are hashed into it, all keys corresponding to a main hash table entry is organized as a binary tree that grows on demand.

First, the 3rd least significant bit is used to divide the keys into left and right subtrees.

To resolve more collisions; each node of the binary tree is further sub-divided based on the 4th least significant bit.

A split is done only if it is needed, i.e., only when there is a collision.

Consider the following state of the hash table (assume the keys are in decimal notation):

5, 9, 4, 13, 10,

(B) 9, 5, 10, 6, 7, 1

10, 9, 6, 7, 13

9, 5, 13, 6, 10, 14

# Q.49

Consider the sliding window flow-control protocol operating between a sender and a receiver over a full-duplex error-free link; The time taken for processing the data frame by the receiver is negligible. The time taken for processing the acknowledgement frame by the sender is negligible. The size of the data frame is 200 bits and the size of the acknowledgement frame is 10 bits. The link data rate in each direction is 1 Mbps (106 bits per second). One way propagation delay of the link is 100 milliseconds. The minimum value of the sender's window size in terms of the number of frames, (rounded to the nearest integer) needed to achieve link utilization of 50% is

# Q.54

A sender (S) transmits a signal, which can be one of the two kinds: H and L with probabilities 0.1 and 0.9 respectively to receiver (R):

In the graph below, the weight of edge (u,v) is the probability of receiving U when u is transmitted, where U, U ∈ {H,L}.

If the received signal is H, the probability that the transmitted signal was H (rounded to 2 decimal places) is:

|H|0.3|0.7|
|L|0.8|0.2|

|---|---|---|
|MOV R1, (5000)|R1 ← MEMORY[5000]|2|
|MOV R2, (R3)|R2 ← MEMORY[R3]|2|
|ADD R2, R1|R2 ← R1 + R2|2|
|MOV (R3), R2|MEMORY[R3] ← R2|2|
|INC R3|R3 ← R3 + 1|2|
|DEC R1|R1 ← R1 - 1|2|
|BNZ 1004|Branch not zero to the given absolute address|2|
|HALT|Stop|2|
