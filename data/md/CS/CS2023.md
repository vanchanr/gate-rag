Q.34 A keyboard connected to a computer is used at a rate of 1 keystroke per second. The computer system polls the keyboard every 10 ms (milli seconds) to check for a keystroke and consumes 100 μs (micro seconds) for each poll. If it is determined after polling that a key has been pressed, the system consumes an additional 200 μs to process the keystroke. Let T1 denote the fraction of a second spent in polling and processing a keystroke.

In an alternative implementation, the system uses interrupts instead of polling. An interrupt is raised for every keystroke. It takes a total of 1 ms for servicing an interrupt and processing a keystroke. Let T2 denote the fraction of a second spent in servicing the interrupt and processing a keystroke. The ratio
T1 / T2 is . (Rounded off to one decimal place)

Q.52 Suppose in a web browser, you click on the www.gate-2023.in URL. The browser cache is empty. The IP address for this URL is not cached in your local host, so a DNS lookup is triggered (by the local DNS server deployed on your local host) over the 3-tier DNS hierarchy in an iterative mode. No resource records are cached anywhere across all DNS servers.

Let RTT denote the round trip time between your local host and DNS servers in the DNS hierarchy. The round trip time between the local host and the web server hosting www.gate-2023.in is also equal to RTT. The HTML file associated with the URL is small enough to have negligible transmission time and negligible rendering time by your web browser, which references 10 equally small objects on the same web server.

Suppose the block size of the file system is 1024 bytes, and a pointer to a block occupies 5 bytes. The system uses binary search on the index file to search for a record with a given key. You may assume that a binary search on an index file of b blocks takes log2 b block accesses in the worst case.
