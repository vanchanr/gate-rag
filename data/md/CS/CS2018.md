Consider the following solution to the producer‑consumer synchronization problem. The shared buffer size is 𝑁. Three semaphores empty, full and mutex are defined with respective initial values of 0, 𝑁 and 1. Semaphore empty denotes the number of available slots in the buffer, for the consumer to read from. Semaphore full denotes the number of available slots in the buffer, for the producer to write to. The placeholder variables, denoted by P, Q, R, and S, in the code below can be assigned either empty or full. The valid semaphore operations are: wait() and signal().

# Q.44

Consider Guwahati (G) and Delhi (D) whose temperatures can be classified as high (𝐻), medium (𝑀) and low (𝐿). Let 𝑃(𝐻𝐺) denote the probability that Guwahati has high temperature. Similarly, 𝑃(𝑀𝐺) and 𝑃(𝐿𝐺) denote the probabilities for medium and low temperatures respectively. Similarly, we use 𝑃(𝐻𝐷), 𝑃(𝑀𝐷) and 𝑃(𝐿𝐷) for Delhi.

The following table gives the conditional probabilities for Delhi’s temperature given Guwahati’s temperature.

| |𝐻𝐷|𝑀𝐷|𝐿𝐷|
|---|---|---|---|
|𝐻𝐺|0.40|0.48|0.12|
|𝑀𝐺|0.10|0.65|0.25|
|𝐿𝐺|0.01|0.50|0.49|

Consider the first row in the table above. The first entry denotes that if Guwahati has high temperature (𝐻𝐺), then the probability of Delhi also having a high temperature (𝐻𝐷) is 0.40. Similarly, the next two entries are 𝑃(𝑀𝐷|𝐻𝐺) = 0.48 and 𝑃(𝐿𝐷|𝐻𝐺) = 0.12. Similarly for the other rows.

If it is known that 𝑃(𝐻𝐺) = 0.2, 𝑃(𝑀𝐺) = 0.5, and 𝑃(𝐿𝐺) = 0.3, then the probability (correct to two decimal places) that Guwahati has high temperature given that Delhi has high temperature is _______.

Consider the following undirected graph G:

Choose a value for x that will maximize the number of minimum weight spanning trees (MWSTs) of G. The number of MWSTs of G for this value of x is ______.

# Q.48

Consider the weights and values of items listed below. Note that there is only one unit of each item.

|Item number|Weight (in Kgs)|Value (in Rupees)|
|---|---|---|
|1|10|60|
|2|7|28|
|3|4|20|
|4|2|24|

The task is to pick a subset of these items such that their total weight is no more than 11 Kgs and their total value is maximized. Moreover, no item may be split. The total value of items picked by an optimal algorithm is denoted by 𝑉opt. A greedy algorithm sorts the items by their value-to-weight ratios in descending order and packs them greedily, starting from the first item in the ordered list. The total value of items picked by the greedy algorithm is denoted by 𝑉greedy. The value of 𝑉opt − 𝑉greedy is ____________.

The instruction pipeline of a RISC processor has the following stages: Instruction Fetch (IF),
Instruction Decode (ID), Operand Fetch (OF), Perform Operation (PO) and Writeback (WB).
The IF, ID, OF and WB stages take 1 clock cycle each for every instruction. Consider a
sequence of 100 instructions. In the PO stage, 40 instructions take 3 clock cycles each, 35

# Q.53

Consider a storage disk with 4 platters (numbered as 0, 1, 2 and 3), 200 cylinders (numbered as 0, 1, … , 199), and 256 sectors per track (numbered as 0, 1, … , 255). The following 6 disk requests of the form [sector number, cylinder number, platter number] are received by the disk controller at the same time:

[120, 72, 2], [180, 134, 1], [60, 20, 0], [212, 86, 3], [56, 116, 2], [118, 16, 1]

Currently the head is positioned at sector number 100 of cylinder 80, and is moving towards higher cylinder numbers. The average power dissipation in moving the head over 100 cylinders is 20 milliwatts and for reversing the direction of the head movement once is 15 milliwatts. Power dissipation associated with rotational latency and switching of head between different platters is negligible.

The total power consumption in milliwatts to satisfy all of the above disk requests using the Shortest Seek Time First disk scheduling algorithm is _______.

# Q.55

Consider a simple communication system where multiple nodes are connected by a shared broadcast medium (like Ethernet or wireless). The nodes in the system use the following carrier-sense based medium access protocol. A node that receives a packet to transmit will carrier-sense the medium for 5 units of time. If the node does not detect any other transmission in this duration, it starts transmitting its packet in the next time unit. If the node detects another transmission, it waits until this other transmission finishes, and then begins to carrier-sense for 5 time units again. Once they start to transmit, nodes do not perform any collision detection and continue transmission even if a collision occurs. All transmissions last for 20 units of time. Assume that the transmission signal travels at the speed of 10 meters per unit time in the medium.

Assume that the system has two nodes P and Q, located at a distance d meters from each other. P starts transmitting a packet at time t=0 after successfully completing its carrier-sense phase. Node Q has a packet to transmit at time t=0 and begins to carrier-sense the medium. The maximum distance d (in meters, rounded to the closest integer) that allows Q to successfully avoid a collision between its proposed transmission and P’s ongoing transmission is _____.
