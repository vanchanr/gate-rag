These are called twins of each other. A twin pointer is a pointer from an adjacency list entry to its twin. If |E| = m and |V | = n, and the memory size is not a constraint, what is the time complexity of the most efficient algorithm to set the twin pointer in each entry in each adjacency list?

- (A) Œò(n2)
- (B) Œò(n + m)
- (C) Œò(m2)
- (D) Œò(n4)

# Q.46

A student wrote two context-free grammars G1 and G2 for generating a single C-like array declaration. The dimension of the array is at least one. For example, int a[10][3]; The grammars use D as the start symbol, and use six terminal symbols int, ;, id, [, ], num.

|Grammar G1|Grammar G2|
|---|---|
|D ‚Üí int L;|D ‚Üí int L;|
|L ‚Üí id [E|L ‚Üí id E|
|E ‚Üí num]|E ‚Üí E[num]|
|E ‚Üí num] [E|E ‚Üí [num]|

Which of the grammars correctly generate the declaration mentioned above?

- (B) Only G1
- (C) Only G2
- (D) Neither G1 nor G2

# Q.50

A file system uses an in-memory cache to cache disk blocks. The miss rate of the cache is shown in the figure. The latency to read a block from the cache is 1 ms and to read a block from the disk is 10 ms. Assume that the cost of checking whether a block exists in the cache is negligible. Available cache sizes are in multiples of 10 MB.

| | |Miss rate (%)|
|---|---|
|0|10|90|
|20|30|80|
|40|50|70|
|60|70|60|
|80|90|50|
|100|110|40|
|120|130|30|
|140|150|20|
|160|170|10|
|180|190|0|

The smallest cache size required to ensure an average read latency of less than 6 ms is MB.
