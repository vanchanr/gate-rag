3. Click on Save & Next to save your answer for the current question and then go to the next question.
4. Click on Mark for Review & Next to save your answer for the current question and also mark it for review, and then go to the next question.
---
Caution: Note that your answer for the current question will not be saved, if you navigate to another question directly by clicking on a question number without saving the answer to the previous question.

You can view all the questions by clicking on the Question Paper button. This feature is provided, so that if you want you can just see the entire question paper at a glance.

# Answering a Question :

# 8. Procedure for answering a multiple choice (MCQ) type question:

1. Choose one answer from the 4 options (A,B,C,D) given below the question, click on the bubble placed before the chosen option.
2. To deselect your chosen answer, click on the bubble of the chosen option again or click on the Clear Response button.
3. To change your chosen answer, click on the bubble of another option.
4. To save your answer, you MUST click on the Save & Next button.

# 9. Procedure for answering a numerical answer type question:

1. To enter a number as your answer, use the virtual numerical keypad.
2. A fraction (e.g. -0.3 or -.3) can be entered as an answer with or without '0' before the decimal point. As many as four decimal points, e.g. 12.5435 or 0.003 or -932.6711 or 12.82 can be entered.
3. To clear your answer, click on the Clear Response button.
4. To save your answer, you MUST click on the Save & Next button.

# 10. To mark a question for review, click on the Mark for Review & Next button. If an answer is selected (for MCQ) or entered (for numerical answer type) for a question that is Marked for Review, that answer will be considered in the evaluation unless the status is modified by the candidate.

# 11. To change your answer to a question that has already been answered, first select that question for answering and then follow the procedure for answering that type of question.

# 12. Note that ONLY Questions for which answers are saved or marked for review after answering will be considered for evaluation.

# Choosing a Section :

# 13. Sections in this question paper are displayed on the top bar of the screen. Questions in a Section can be viewed by clicking on the name of that Section. The Section you are currently viewing will be highlighted.

A user on host A sends a file of size 103 bytes to host B through routers R1 and R2 in three different ways. In the first case a single packet containing the complete file is transmitted from A to B. In the second case, the file is split into 10 equal parts, and these packets are transmitted from A to B. In the third case, the file is split into 20 equal parts and these packets are sent from A to B. Each packet contains 100 bytes of header information along with the user data.

# Q.32

Three processes A, B and C each execute a loop of 100 iterations. In each iteration of the loop, a process performs a single computation that requires tc CPU milliseconds and then initiates a single I/O operation that lasts for tio milliseconds. It is assumed that the computer where the processes execute has sufficient number of I/O devices and the OS of the computer assigns different I/O devices to each process. Also, the scheduling overhead of the OS is negligible. The processes have the following characteristics:

|Process id|tc|tio|
|---|---|---|
|A|100 ms|500 ms|
|B|350 ms|500 ms|
|C|200 ms|500 ms|

screen will display the remaining time available for you to complete the examination.
When the timer reaches zero, the examination will end by itself. You need not
terminate the examination or submit your paper.
3. Any useful data required for your paper can be viewed by clicking on the Useful
Common Data button that appears on the screen.
4. Use the scribble pad provided to you for any rough work. Submit the scribble pad at
the end of the examination.
5. You are allowed to use a non-programmable type calculator, however, sharing of
calculators is not allowed.
6. The Question Palette displayed on the right side of screen will show the status of
each question using one of the following symbols:
- You have not visited the question
- You have not answered the question
- You have answered the question
- You have NOT answered the question; but have marked the question for review
- You have answered the question; but marked it for review

The Marked for Review status for a question simply indicates that you would like to look at
that question again. If a question is answered, but marked for review, then the answer will
be considered for evaluation unless the status is modified by the candidate.

# Q.43

An instruction pipeline has five stages, namely, instruction fetch (IF), instruction decode and register fetch (ID/RF), instruction execution (EX), memory access (MEM), and register writeback (WB) with stage latencies 1 ns, 2.2 ns, 2 ns, 1 ns, and 0.75 ns, respectively (ns stands for nanoseconds). To gain in terms of frequency, the designers have decided to split the ID/RF stage into three stages (ID, RF1, RF2) each of latency 2.2/3 ns. Also, the EX stage is split into two stages (EX1, EX2) each of latency 1 ns. The new design has a total of eight pipeline stages. A program has 20% branch instructions which execute in the EX stage and produce the next instruction pointer at the end of the EX stage in the old design and at the end of the EX2 stage in the new design. The IF stage stalls after fetching a branch instruction until the next instruction pointer is computed. All instructions other than the branch instruction have an average CPI of one in both the designs.

# Q.44

The execution times of this program on the old and the new design are respectively. The value of P/Q is __________.

The memory access time is 1 nanosecond for a read operation with a hit in cache, 5 nanoseconds for a read operation with a miss in cache, 2 nanoseconds for a write operation with a hit in cache and 10 nanoseconds for a write operation with a miss in cache. Execution of a sequence of instructions involves 100 instruction fetch operations, 60 memory operand read operations and 40 memory operand write operations. The cache hit-ratio is 0.9. The average memory access time (in nanoseconds) in executing the sequence of instructions is __________.
