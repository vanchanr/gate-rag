Read the following instructions carefully:

This question paper contains 24 pages including blank pages for rough work. Please check all pages and report discrepancy, if any:

Write your registration number, your name and name of the examination centre at the specified locations on the right half of the Optical Response Sheet (ORS).

Using HB pencil, darken the appropriate bubble under each digit of your registration number and the letters corresponding to your paper code.

All questions in this paper are of objective type.

Questions must be answered on the ORS by darkening the appropriate bubble (marked A, B, C, D) against the question number on the left-hand side of the ORS. For each question, darken the bubble for the correct answer.

In case you wish to change an answer, erase the old answer completely. More than one answer bubbled against a question will be treated as an incorrect response.

There are a total of 65 questions carrying 100 marks.

Questions Q.1 to Q.25 will carry 1 mark each, and questions Q.26 to Q.55 will carry 2 marks each.

Questions Q.48 to Q.55 (2 pairs) are common data questions and question pairs (Q.52, Q.53) and (Q.54, Q.55) are linked answer questions. The answer to the second question of the linked pair depends on the answer to the first question of the pair. If the first question in the linked pair is incorrectly answered, the answer to the second question in the pair will not be evaluated.

Questions Q.56 to Q.65 belong to General Aptitude (GA). Questions Q.56 to Q.65 will begin on fresh pages starting from page 15.

Un-attempted questions will carry zero marks.

Wrong answers will carry negative marks. For Q.1 - Q.25 and Q.56 - Q.60, 0.25 mark will be deducted for each wrong answer. For Q.26 - Q.55 and Q.61 - Q.65, 0.5 mark will be deducted for each wrong answer.

There will be negative marks only for wrong answers to the first question of the linked answer question pair, i.e., for Q.52 and Q.54, 0.25 mark will be deducted for each wrong answer. There is no negative marking for Q.53 and Q.55.

Calculator (without data connectivity) is allowed in the examination hall.

Charts, graph sheets or tables are NOT allowed in the examination hall.

Rough work can be done on the question paper itself. Additionally, blank pages are provided at the end of the question paper for rough work.
