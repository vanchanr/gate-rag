# Q.6

Some people believe that “what gets measured, improves”. Some others believe that “what gets measured, gets gamed”. One possible reason for the difference in the beliefs is the work culture in organizations. In organizations with good work culture, metrics help improve outcomes.

Q.54 Consider a system with 2 KB direct mapped data cache with a block size of 64 bytes. The system has a physical address space of 64 KB and a word length of 16 bits. During the execution of a program, four data words P, Q, R, and S are accessed in that order 10 times (i.e., PQRSPQRS…). Hence, there are 40 accesses to data cache altogether. Assume that the data cache is initially empty and no other data words are accessed by the program. The addresses of the first bytes of P, Q, R, and S are 0xA248, 0xC28A, 0xCA8A, and 0xA262, respectively. For the execution of the above program, which of the following statements is/are TRUE with respect to the data cache?

- (A) Every access to S is a hit.
- (B) Once P is brought to the cache it is never evicted.
- (C) At the end of the execution only R and S reside in the cache.
- (D) Every access to R evicts Q from the cache.

Consider a network with three routers P, Q, R shown in the figure below. All the links have cost of unity.

The routers exchange distance vector routing information and have converged on the routing tables, after which the link Q−R fails.

The probability of a routing loop formation (rounded off to one decimal place) between P and Q, leading to count-to-infinity problem, is___________.

# Q.61

A processor X1 operating at 2 GHz has a standard 5-stage RISC instruction pipeline having a base CPI (cycles per instruction) of one without any pipeline hazards. For a given program P that has 30% branch instructions, control hazards incur 2 cycles stall for every branch. A new version of the processor X2 operating at the same clock frequency has an additional branch predictor unit (BPU) that completely eliminates stalls for correctly predicted branches. There is neither any savings nor any additional stalls for wrong predictions. There are no structural hazards and data hazards for X1 and X2. If the BPU has a prediction accuracy of 80%, the speed up (rounded off to two decimal places) obtained by X2 over X1 in executing P is __________.

Q.65 Consider the following grammar along with translation rules.

|S| |T| |
|T|T1|%R|{T•val = T1•val R•val}|

|R|id| |{R•val = id•val}|

Here # and % are operators and id is a token that represents an integer and id•val represents the corresponding integer value. The set of non-terminals is {S, T, R, P}, and a subscripted non-terminal indicates an instance of the non-terminal.

Using this translation scheme, the computed value of S•val for root of the parse tree for the expression 20 #10%5 #8%2%2 is _____________.
