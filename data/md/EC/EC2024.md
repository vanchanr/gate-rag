# Q.52

Which of the following statements is/are true for a BJT with respect to its DC current gain β?

- (A) Under high-level injection condition in forward active mode, β will decrease with increase in the magnitude of collector current.
- (B) Under low-level injection condition in forward active mode, where the current at the emitter-base junction is dominated by recombination-generation process, β will decrease with increase in the magnitude of collector current.
- (C) β will be lower when the BJT is in saturation region compared to when it is in active region.
- (D) A higher value of β will lead to a lower value of the collector-to-emitter breakdown voltage.
