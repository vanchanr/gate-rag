The circuit in the figure contains a shunt capacitor across the load. The current source driving the load has an inductor and a resistor in series, with zero resistance. The switch is closed at time t = 0. The ammeter is assumed to have zero initial reading.

| | | |Ammeter|Switch|Current Source| |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1 A|Load| | |10 mH| | |
|Shunt Capacitor| | | | | | |
| | | |100 pF|5 kΩ| | |

Initially, when the switch is closed, the ammeter reads zero ampere. After t = 0, the capacitor is discharged and the maximum ammeter reading that one will observe after the switch is closed (rounded off to two decimal places) is:

Q.48 A unity feedback system that uses proportional-integral (PI) control is shown in the figure:

X(s) - Kp + K; ~ Y(s)

s^2 + 4s + 5s + 2

The stability of the overall system is controlled by tuning the PI control parameters Kp and K;: The maximum value of K; that can be chosen so as to keep the overall system stable O, in the worst case, marginally stable (rounded off to three decimal places) is

Q.49 A sinusoidal message signal has a modulator with phase deviation constant 2 rad/volt. If the carrier signal is c(t) = 2 cos(2π10^6t), the maximum instantaneous frequency of the phase modulated signal (rounded off to one decimal place) is Hz.

Q.50 Consider a superheterodyne receiver tuned to 600 kHz. If the local oscillator feeds a 1000 kHz signal to the mixer, the image frequency (in integer) is kHz.

Q.51 In a high school having equal number of boy students and girl students, 75% of the students study Science and the remaining 25% students study Commerce. Commerce students are two times more likely to be a boy than are Science students. The amount of information gained in knowing that a Cfc (rounded off to two decimal places) is

Q.52 A message signal having peak-to-peak value of 2 V, root mean square value of 0.1 V and bandwidth of 5 kHz is sampled and fed to pulse code modulation (PCM) system that uses a uniform quantizer: The PCM output is transmitted over a channel that can support a maximum transmission rate of 50 kbps. Assuming that the maximum signal to quantization noise ratio that can be obtained by the PCM system (rounded off to two decimal places) is

Q.53 Consider a polar non-return to zero (NRZ) waveform; using +2 V and -2 V for representing binary '1' and '0' respectively, is transmitted in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise with variance 0.4 V2. If the threshold voltage for maximum transmission of a binary '1' is 0.4, the optimum a priori probability of transmission (rounded off to two decimal places) is

Q.54 A standard air-filled rectangular waveguide with dimensions 8 cm x b cm; operates at 3.4 GHz. For the dominant mode of wave propagation, the phase velocity of the signal is Vp: The value (rounded off to two decimal places) denotes the velocity of light
