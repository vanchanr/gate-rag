# Q.8

The Cricket Board has long recognized John’s potential as a leader of the team. However, his on-field temper has always been a matter of concern for them since his junior days. While this aggression has filled stadia with die-hard fans, it has taken a toll on his own batting. Until recently, it appeared that he found it difficult to convert his aggression into big scores. Over the past three seasons though, that picture of John has been replaced by a cerebral, calculative and successful batsman-captain. After many years, it appears that the team has finally found a complete captain.

Which of the following statements can be logically inferred from the above paragraph?

(i) Even as a junior cricketer, John was considered a good captain.
