Consider a solid slab of thickness 2L and uniform cross section A. The volumetric rate of heat generation within the slab is & (W m3). The slab loses heat by convection at both ends to air with heat transfer coefficient h. Assuming steady state, one-dimensional heat transfer; the temperature profile within the slab along the thickness is given by:

T(x) = IL2 / (2k) (' + Ts) for -L < x < L

where k is the thermal conductivity of the slab and Ts is the surface temperature. If Ts = 350 K and ambient air temperature Tc = 300 K, and Biot number (based on L as the characteristic length) is 0.5, the maximum temperature in the slab is K (round off to nearest integer).

# Q.46

A distillation column handling a binary mixture of A and B is operating at total reflux. It has two ideal stages including the reboiler: The mole fraction of the more volatile component in the residue (Xj) is 0.1. The average relative volatility αAB is 4. The mole fraction of A in the distillate (xp) is (round off to decimal places).

Q.47 In a batch drying experiment; kg H2O/kg dry solid is dried to a final moisture content of 0.1 kg H2O/kg dry solid from an initial moisture content of 0.35 kg H2O/kg dry solid. The equilibrium moisture content is assumed to be zero. The rate of drying is 2 kg H2O/(m2.h) in the constant rate regime. The entire falling rate regime is assumed to be uniformly linear. The mass of the dry solid per unit area is (round off to nearest integer):

Q.48 As shown in the figure below, air flows in parallel to a freshly painted solid surface of width 10 m, along the Z-direction. The equilibrium vapor concentration of the volatile component A in the paint at the air-paint interface along the y-direction decreases linearly from this value to zero over a distance; the average velocity of the air stream is 0.033 m s-1 and its velocity profile (in m s-1) is given by:

v(y) = 10y2 where y is in meter. Let CAm represent the flow averaged concentration: The ratio of CAm to CAi is (round off to 2 decimal places).

Q.49 The following isothermal autocatalytic reaction, A + B &rarr; 2B (-rA) = 0.1C4CB (mol L-1 s-1) is carried out in an ideal continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) operating at steady state. Pure A at CSTR The space time of the CSTR is 90% of A is converted in the TR is seconds:

Q.50 Reactant A decomposes to produce B and C in the presence of an enzyme in a well-stirred batch reactor: (-rA) = 0.05 + CA (mol L-1 min-1) If the initial concentration of A is 0.02 mol L-1, the time taken to achieve 50% conversion of A is min (round off to 2 decimal places).

Q.51 The following homogeneous, irreversible reaction involving ideal gases, A &rarr; 7B + C (-rA) = 0.5C4 (mol L-1 s-1) is carried out in a steady state ideal plug flow reactor (PFR) operating at entering at 2 m s-1 isothermal and isobaric conditions. The feed stream consists of pure A, In order to achieve 50% conversion of A, the required length of the PFR is meters (round off to 2 decimal places).

Q.52 A system has a transfer function G(s) = 3e-12s + 1 When a step change of magnitude M is given to the system input; the final value of the system output is measured to be 120. The value of M is:

Q.53 A process has a transfer function G(s) = Y(s)/X(s) = 20/(90000s2 + 240s + 1) Initially the process is at steady state with x(t = 0) = 0.4 and y(t = 0) = 100. If a step change in x is given from 0.4 to 0.5, the maximum value of Y that will be observed before it reaches the new steady state is (round off to 1 decimal place):

# Q.54

Operating labor requirements in the chemical process industry is described in terms of the plant capacity € (kg day-1) over a wide range (103 p L= CCB).

Lis 60 when C is 2 X 104

Lis 70 when C is 6 X 104

The value of L when C is 105 kg day-1 is (round off to nearest integer).

# Q.55

A viscous liquid is pumped through a pipe network in a chemical plant. The annual pumping cost per unit length of pipe is given by:

pun = 48.13 + 42p D4

The annual cost of the installed piping system per unit length of pipe is:

Cpiping = 45.92D

Here, D is the inner diameter of the pipe in meter, q is the volumetric flow rate of the liquid in m3 s-1, and dp is the viscosity of the liquid in Pa.s.

If the viscosity of the liquid is 20 x 10-3 Pa.s and the volumetric flow rate of the liquid is 104 m3 s-1, the economic inner diameter of the pipe is meter (round off to 3 decimal places).
