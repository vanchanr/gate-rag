Read the following paragraph and choose the correct statement.

Climate change has reduced human security and threatened human well being. An ignored reality of human progress is that human security largely depends upon environmental security. But on the contrary, human progress seems contradictory to environmental security. To keep up both at the required level is a challenge to be addressed by one and all. One of the ways to curb the climate change may be suitable scientific innovations - while the other may be the Gandhian perspective on small scale progress with focus on sustainability.

- Human progress and security are positively associated with environmental security.
- Human progress is contradictory to environmental security.
- Human security is contradictory to environmental security.
