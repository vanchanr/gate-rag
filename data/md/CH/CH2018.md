Considering 0 °C as reference temperature, the enthalpy of air (in kJ/kg) at its adiabatic saturation temperature of 35 °C is ___________ (rounded off to two decimal places).

# Q.54

In a roll crusher, rolls of diameter 1 m each are set in such a manner that minimum clearance between the crushing surfaces is 15 mm. If the angle of nip is 31° the maximum diameter of the particle (in mm) which can be crushed is ____________ (rounded off to third decimal place).

# Q.55

A hot liquid is to be cooled in a 1‑1 shell and tube heat exchanger from 80 °C to 50 °C. Cooling water enters the tube side at 30 °C, and exits at 45 °C. The properties of the liquids are constant. Also, the overall heat transfer coefficient is same for counter‑current and co‑current modes. The percentage saving in heat transfer area for counter‑current option with respect to the area of co‑current option is __________ (rounded off to third decimal place).
