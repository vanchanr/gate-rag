The World Bank has declared that it does not plan to offer new financing to Sri Lanka, which is battling its worst economic crisis in decades, until the country has an adequate macroeconomic policy framework in place. In a statement, the World Bank said Sri Lanka needed to adopt structural reforms that focus on economic stabilisation and tackle the root causes of its crisis. The latter has starved it of foreign exchange and led to shortages of food, fuel, and medicines. The bank is repurposing resources under existing loans to help alleviate shortages of essential items such as medicine, cooking gas, fertiliser, meals for children, and cash for vulnerable households.

Based only on the above passage, which one of the following statements can be inferred with certainty?

- (A) According to the World Bank, the root cause of Sri Lanka’s economic crisis is that it does not have enough foreign exchange.
- (B) The World Bank has stated that it will advise the Sri Lankan government about how to tackle the root causes of its economic crisis.
- (C) According to the World Bank, Sri Lanka does not yet have an adequate macroeconomic policy framework.

A perfectly insulated, concentric tube countercurrent heat exchanger is used to cool lubricating oil using water as a coolant (see figure below). Oil enters the outer annulus at a mass flow rate of 2 kg.s−1 with a temperature of 100 °C and leaves at 40 °C. Water enters the inner tube at a mass flow rate of 1 kg.s−1 with a temperature of 20 °C and leaves at 80 °C. Use specific heats of oil and water as 2089 J.kg−1K−1 and 4178 J.kg−1K−1, respectively. There is no phase change in both the streams. Under steady-state conditions, the number of transfer units (NTU) is _______ (in integer).
