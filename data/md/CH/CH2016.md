Q.48 A liquid phase irreversible reaction  A + B → C  is carried out in an adiabatic CSTR operating under steady state conditions. The reaction is elementary and follows the first order rate law. For this reaction, the figure below shows the conversion (XA) of A as a function of temperature (T) for different values of the rate of reaction (r0) in mol m-3 s-1 for each curve. This figure can be used to determine the rate of the reaction at a particular temperature, for a given conversion of A.

The inlet stream does not contain B and the concentration of A in the inlet stream is 5 mol/m3. The molar feed rate of A is 100 mol/s. A steady state energy balance for this CSTR results in the following relation: T = 350 + 25XA where T is the temperature (in K) of the exit stream and XA is the conversion of A in the CSTR. For an exit conversion of 80 % of A, the volume (in m3, rounded off to the first decimal place) of CSTR required is _______

# Q.49

A porous pellet with Pt dispersed in it is used to carry out a catalytic reaction. Following two scenarios are possible.

Scenario 1: Pt present throughout the pores of the pellet is used for catalyzing the reaction.

Scenario 2: Pt present only in the immediate vicinity of the external surface of the pellet is used for catalyzing the reaction.

At a large value of Thiele modulus, which one of the following statements is TRUE?

- (A) Since the reaction rate is much greater than the diffusion rate, Scenario 1 occurs
- (B) Since the reaction rate is much greater than the diffusion rate, Scenario 2 occurs
- (C) Since the reaction rate is much lower than the diffusion rate, Scenario 1 occurs
- (D) Since the reaction rate is much lower than the diffusion rate, Scenario 2 occurs

# Q.51

A liquid flows through an “equal percentage” valve at a rate of 2 m3/h when the valve is 10% open. When the valve opens to 20% the flowrate increases to 3 m3/h. Assume that the pressure drop across the valve and the density of the liquid remain constant. When the valve opens to 50%, the flowrate (in m3/h, rounded off to the second decimal place) is_______

A PI controller with integral time constant of 0.1 min is to be designed to control a process with transfer function

𝑓(𝑠) = 𝑠² + 2𝑠 + 100

Assume the transfer functions of the measuring element and the final control element are both unity (𝑓ₘ = 1, 𝑓ₑ = 1). The gain (rounded off to the first decimal place) of the controller that will constitute the critical condition for stability of the PI feedback control system is _______

# Q.53

For a unit step input, the response of a second order system is

𝑦(𝑡) = 𝑓ₑ(1 - e^(-𝜁𝜔ₙ𝑡)sin(𝜔ₙ√(1 - 𝜁²)𝑡 + 𝜃))

where, 𝑓ₑ is the steady state gain, 𝜁 is the damping coefficient, 𝜔ₙ is the natural period of oscillation and 𝜃 is the phase lag. The overshoot of the system is exp(-√(1 - 𝜁²)π/√(1 - 𝜁²)). For a unit step input, the response of the system from an initial steady state condition at t = 0 is shown in the figure below.
